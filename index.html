        <h3>What made you decide to take this "Web Design" cass?</h3>
        <p> Before being enrolled in this class, I was in a different elective. At first, I did not want to take this class because I remembered how difficult Multimedia 1 was for me. Now, I am glad I have taken this class because I feel that Mr. Scott Is a great teacher and although Multimedia II is still challenging, It's fun as well.

        <h3>Will knowing how to code ever come in handy?</h3>
        <p> I think knowing how to code will benefit me in the future because with whatever I want to do when I get older, I'll probably want a website and knowing how to create my own will definitely be useful.

        <h3>What do you want to do in the future?</h3>
        <p> I love singing. I love how I feel when I sing and the beautiful noises that are created by opening your mouth. I do wamt to make a career out of it but I am still hesitant because I am not sure if I'll succeed, but it is my passion and by singing, I'm happy. Perhaps, I could become a voice instructor or hotel singer.
